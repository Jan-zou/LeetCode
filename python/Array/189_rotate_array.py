Description:
    Rotate an array of n elements to the right by k steps.
    For example, with n = 7 and k = 3, the array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is rotated to [5,6,7,1,2,3,4].
Note:
    Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.
Hint:
    Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?
